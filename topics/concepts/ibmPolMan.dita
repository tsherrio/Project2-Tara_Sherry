            <title>IBM StoredIQ Policy Manager</title>
            <p>IBM StoredIQ Policy Manager allows users to run mature policies and processes at
                scale across a wider range of data.</p>
            <image conkeyref="pics/polMa"/>
            <p>The users can define and run systemwide policies, focusing on the execution of the
                process rather than understanding or reviewing affected data objects. Additionally,
                with reports of IBM StoredIQ Policy Manager, you can record what actions were
                conducted, when they were conducted, and what data was affected by the policy's
                execution.</p>
